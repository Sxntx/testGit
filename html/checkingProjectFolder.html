            now we need to check what's happening on the projects folders just
            en netbeans cuz when we try to git clone the project from
            github it is not runin or appearing on the Projects floder
            unstead it appears on the Favorite folder, so we need to check
            how to do to get the project folder from git into projects folders
            on netbeasns instead of FAVORITES
        </span>
